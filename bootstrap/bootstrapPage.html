                <p>Exclusively available at WAVES, our seasonal Surf Camps are perfect for kids and teens aged 5 to 17. We’ve been
                operating since 2002, and our intensive half-day or full-day surf school sessions help students build confidence and
                improve their skills quickly.</p>
