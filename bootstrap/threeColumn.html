                        is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on
                        September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to "Des Moines" in 1857.[7] It is located on, and named
                        after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivière des Moines, meaning "River of
                        the Monks". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate.[8] The six-county metropolitan area is
                        ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the
                        United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the
                        larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.

                        base. The city was credited as the "number one spot for U.S. insurance companies" in a Business Wire article and named
                        the third-largest "insurance capital" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the
                        Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue
                        Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited,
                        Marsh, Monsanto, and Corteva have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft,
                        Hewlett-Packard, and Facebook[10][11] have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area.
                        
                        Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first
                        caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A
                        2007 article in The New York Times said, "If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up
                        and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines."

                        <p class="card-text">Des Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843–46), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted
                        from the name given by French colonists. Des Moines (pronounced [de mwan] (About this soundlisten); formerly [de mwɛn])
                        translates literally to either "from the monks" or "of the monks". The historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was
                        derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means "Loon".
                        
                        Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant "people by
                        the portage" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters
                        between the Moingona and European explorers took place.
                        
                        In 2015, Michael McCafferty of Indiana University, while studying the Miami-Illinois language, concluded that the name
                        was actually a derisive term coined by the Peoria tribe. McCafferty agrees with other linguists that the “Moines” in Des
                        Moines is a French derivation of Moingoana. What he discovered, however, was that it wasn’t the actual name of the
                        neighboring tribe; it was an insulting nickname they hurled at their rivals. It translates, essentially, as “the
                        feces-faces.”
                        
                        One popular interpretation of "Des Moines" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French
                        Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at
                        Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the
                        Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.
