                Des Moines is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It
                is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on
                September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to "Des Moines" in 1857.[7] It is located on, and named
                after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi√®re des Moines, meaning "River of
                the Monks".

                    Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first
                    caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A
                    2007 article in The New York Times said, "If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up
                    and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines."

                    Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant "people by
                    the portage" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters
                    between the Moingona and European explorers took place.
