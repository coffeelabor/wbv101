    <p>GE has brief descriptions of their wind program expectations:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.ge.com/renewableenergy/wind-energy/onshore-wind">
        <q>
            Global onshore wind power farms are expected to grow by more than 60 GW in 2019, and global capacity from onshore wind
            energy applications is projected to reach nearly 750 GW by 2022.

        <q>
            GE is harnessing this increasing onshore wind energy potential with a broad family of smart, modular turbines that are
            uniquely suited for a variety of wind environments. Our onshore wind power technology and services can help improve
            cost, capacity and performance over the life of your onshore wind power plant, and our newest turbines are equipped with
            a digital infrastructure that allows you to connect, monitor, predict and optimize unit and wind farm energy
            performance.

    <p>GE's numbers on maintenance and profit are:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.ge.com/renewableenergy/wind-energy/onshore-wind">
    <q>
        On average, our onshore wind farm maintenance and energy services <strong>improve Annual Energy Production (AEP) by 5% and
            increase profits by 20%</strong>. Our Repower program for onshore wind farms offers customers an affordable way to upgrade aging
            onshore wind turbines, increasing fleet power output up to 25% and adding up to 20 years to turbine life from the time
            of repowering

    <p>One model of wind turbine is the <strong><em>5mw Cypress platform</em></strong>.  It has the following:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.ge.com/renewableenergy/wind-energy/onshore-wind/4-5-mw-platform-cypress">
        <q>
            GE Renewable Energy has launched its new onshore wind turbine platform, named Cypress, and the next model from that
            platform, GE’s 5.3-158 MW wind turbine.
            
            The 5 MW onshore wind turbine platform advances the proven technology of GE’s 2 MW and 3 MW fleets, which serves an
            installed base of nearly 20 GW, while also using architecture and innovations from the 4.8-158 wind turbine introduced
            in 2017.
        </q>

    <p>The Cypress platform has the following specifications:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.ge.com/renewableenergy/wind-energy/onshore-wind/4-5-mw-platform-cypress">
            <ul>
                <li>Output(MW): 5.3</li>
                <li>Rotor Diameter(m): 158</li>
                <li>Hub Heights(m): 101,121,151 & 161</li>
                <li>Vref(m/s): ~37-40</li>
