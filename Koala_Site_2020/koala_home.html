      The Koala Bear National Information Center (KBNIC) is the principal
      non-profit, non-government organization dedicated to the conservation and
      effective management of the wild koala and its habitat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The KBNIC was formed in 2006. Since our founding the KBNIC has grown from
      a small group of people interested in researching koala disease, to a
      well-known, global organization with a strong track record in strategic
      koala research, conservation and community education with a huge focus on
      mapping -- our absolute strength.

      Koalas are disappearing. Loss of koala habitat and koala food trees
      (eucalyptus leaves) is the leading koala threat. Our cuddly koalas are
      loved around the world. Often called a koala bear, they are actually
      marsupials not koala bears. Please help koalas by supporting the
      Australian Koala Foundation.
