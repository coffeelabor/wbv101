      <p>
        The Koala Bear National Information Center (KBNIC) is the principal
        non-profit, non-government organization dedicated to the conservation
        and effective management of the wild koala and its habitat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The KBNIC was formed in 2006. Since our founding the KBNIC has grown
        from a small group of people interested in researching koala disease, to
        a well-known, global organization with a strong track record in
        strategic koala research, conservation and community education with a
        huge focus on mapping -- our absolute strength.
      </p>

        Koalas are disappearing. Loss of koala habitat and koala food trees
        (eucalyptus leaves) is the leading koala threat. Our cuddly koalas are
        loved around the world. Often called a koala bear, they are actually
        marsupials not koala bears. Please help koalas by supporting the
        Australian Koala Foundation.
