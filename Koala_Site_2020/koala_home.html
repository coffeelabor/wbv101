        The Koala Bear National Information Center (KBNIC) is the principal
        non-profit, non-government organization dedicated to the conservation
        and effective management of the wild koala and its habitat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The KBNIC was formed in 2006. Since our founding the KBNIC has grown
        from a small group of people interested in researching koala disease, to
        a well-known, global organization with a strong track record in
        strategic koala research, conservation and community education with a
        huge focus on mapping -- our absolute strength.

        Koalas are disappearing. Loss of koala habitat and koala food trees
        (eucalyptus leaves) is the leading koala threat. Our cuddly koalas are
        loved around the world. Often called a koala bear, they are actually
        marsupials not koala bears. Please help koalas by supporting the
        Australian Koala Foundation.
